# Unofficial desktop application

This is a packager created with Electron.js what wrapps https://maiar.exchange in a installable application for macOS, Windows and Linux,
the main idea behind it so to prevent the Maiar DEX users to log in and make transactions on malicious copies of the Maiar Dex.

Please let me know if you want some extra features implemented.
